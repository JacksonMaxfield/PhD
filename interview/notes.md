   > - Informatics is collaborative and interdisciplanary

   2. "How do you work?"

   > - Project / paper based
   > - Documentation and planning
   > - Collaborative, interdisciplanary teams

   3. "Building production systems isn't the same as research?"

   > - Tests, docs, and CI are the basis of good research
   > - Production systems just take the little extra step to scale
   > - Building prod systems -- no, I like easy to follow and trusted work

   4. "What are some things that would be a dealbreaker for you in joining a lab?"

   > - Not neccessarily a dealbreaker, but I like well planned projects
   > - I have some work to do on this too
   > - Understand the need to shift, but also desire to have long planned work

2. Papers / Literature

   1. "What types of papers do you like to read?"

   > - Mix of nitty gritty and blue sky

   2. "Who do you like reading?"

   > - Authors who explain the fundamentals and implications of their work
   > - Jon Gjengset (MIT CSAIL) thesis appendix ("Noria in Simpler Terms")
   > - Noria -- partial state and dataflow-based materialized views
   > - Clear implications and reason for study
   > - Dana Boyd's article on VP of Eng instead of CTO

   >   - Blue sky, models and recommendation systems, infrastructure
   >
   > - CHI (Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems)
