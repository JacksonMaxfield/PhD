# PhD Application Materials and Research

Hi, I am Jackson Maxfield Brown.
I am currently a PhD student at the
[University of Washington Information School](https://ischool.uw.edu/)
working under [Dr. Nicholas Weber](https://nicweber.info/) and
[Dr. Bill Howe](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~billhowe/) in the
[UW DataLab](https://datalab.ischool.uw.edu/). I research and build open
access infrastructures largely pertaining to municipal governments
and large research institutions.

For more details about me, [see my website](https://jacksonmaxfield.github.io).

This repository is meant to act as a transparent record of my time throughout my
PhD from application, acceptance, to student, and candidate (hopefully).

## Application Materials

All application materials are the final state from submission.
They have not been changed in any way. In that way, they may not reflect
my current research interests as they change over time (but they likely
_do_ reflect my interests).

## Interview

Marjority of the notes are my interview _prep_ notes, but I did come back afterwards
and wrote done some of the questions they asked me to my best memory.

## Projects

Semi-random thoughts about potential projects to take on and things that interest me.
Some are much more fleshed out and some will become full projects. In the case that
a document in the projects directory "graduates" to a full research project, there will
be a separate repo (or repos) linked at the top of the document to see for more details.
