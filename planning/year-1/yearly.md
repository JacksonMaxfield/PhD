# Year One Planning and Goals

## Goals

High level goals, more details in each individual section.

- [Publish three to four papers](#publish)
- [Help establish BITS lab and support lab mates and cohort](#support)
- [Develop early idea of dissertation and more specific research area](#develop)
- [Establish connections with potential advising committee](#connect)
- [CDP: Deploy multiple instances and have basic research infrastructure setup for year two large-scale research](#council-data-project)

## Planning

### Publish

Publish three to four papers. Ideally a couple of first author papers and a couple of supporting author papers.

A central goal of these early projects should be to keep them relatively simple and use them to learn the research process. Brainstorming ideas on how to answer a research question, research design, carrying out the experimental procedure, and writing and publishing the results.

I recognize that I have mainly "built" infrastructure and libraries before this and I lack core "research methods" knowledge.

- [x] CDP JOSS -- _published_ -- [https://doi.org/10.21105/joss.03904](https://doi.org/10.21105/joss.03904)
- [ ] Campaign Websites Access Eval -- _in-progress_
- [x] Howe Lab -- _submitted_
- [ ] Minutes Item Segmentation -- _in-progress_
- [ ] Controversial Datasets -- _planning_
- [ ] Speaker Annotation

### Support

Help establish BITS lab and support lab mates and cohort. Just like how I entered my PhD, "it take's a village," and I want to both build my PhD village and support others in their own research.

For BITS specifically, I want to see BITS produce one or two shared papers, contribute to each other's work, and have a lab website where we can share our collective work.

- [x] Start BITS lab meeting
- [ ] Longer term planning for lab w/ Nic
- [ ] BITS lab website
- [ ] Supporting author on lab and cohort papers
- [ ] Help plan and initiate cohort events to build cohort community

### Develop

Developer early idea of dissertation and more specific research area. I have a general idea of what I am interested in: "open processing and open infrastructure, how it's built, how it's maintained, it's successes, and it's failures." However I have so far only really focused on Council Data Project which, while CDP is "open infrastructure" in my opinion, I can't focus too heavily on it as it is just one project in the world of "open infrastructure" problems.

Planning for future research to address these concerns will help reduce my stress long term.

- [ ] Write a more specific research interest statement
- [ ] Brainstorm a couple of "open processing" and "open infrastructure" research questions to work on next year
- [ ] Plan for developing an infrastructure besides CDP, show knowledge in multiple domains that both require infrastructure development

### Connect

I don't just want to stick to the iSchool community, many of my projects have opportunities for collaboration in other departments and I should cross pollinate and learn.

Additionally, in doing so, I should talk about my own work and make a concerted effort to meet other professors to figure out who may be good for my advising committee.

- [ ] Reach out to other labs / professors to ask to join meetings
- [ ] Take a course outside of iSchool in Law, Public Policy, Linguistics, and CSE
- [ ] Give two to three talks on existing and upcoming work
- [ ] Meet professors I would like to have as my advisors for teaching practicum and research practicum in spring quarter or year two.

### Council Data Project

Deploy multiple instances and have basic research infrastructure setup for year two large-scale research. CDP is rapidly growing in complexity, which is great, but we need to start getting more instances out to show the real value of CDP to research.

Additionally as CDP grows, managing the project will become more of a challenge and opportunity to learn project management and communication skills.

While I have personal goals for growing CDP utilization for the general populace that each instance serves, in a research capacity, I want to see more instances and a prototype or plan for a dataset management API.

- [ ] Deploy five more instances
- [ ] Have basic Python API functions for constructing and managing datasets
- [ ] Have scalable governance model and grow the CDP team
- [ ] Apply to a grant specifically for CDP development
