# Year One -- Winter Quarter -- Planning and Goals

## Goals

Each quarter planning should be a subset of the yearly planning goals. Things change quarter to quarter but in general quarters should take and focus on individual parts of the year planning.

High level goals, more details in each individual section.

- [Improving my writing practices and forming good habits](#writing)
- [Make stronger connections and support others](#support)
- [Develop early idea of dissertation and more specific research area](#develop)
- [CDP Notes](#council-data-project)

## Planning

### Writing

Write and submit two to three papers.

Really focus on writing. Try to solidify good practices and habits for improving my own writing style (and an academic writing style) and simply learn to get words on the page. The major focus of my independent study with Nic is to improve my writing practices (while producing a paper for submission), to that end, I should submit that paper, and hopefully one or two more all with a major goal of focusing on the writing process in research.

To that end, I have blocked out an hour of time a day dedicated to writing. And the papers this quarter I am going to focus on are:

- [ ] Campaign Websites Access Eval -- _in-progress_
- [ ] Controversial Datasets -- _planning_
- [ ] CDP JASIST -- _outlined_

### Support

I want this to be a major part of the quarter. I feel like I could have made more and stronger connections in the first quarter and I want to do better this quarter. To me that means taking some time each week to help others in the cohort and lab.

Unfortunately, with COVID it seems like there may be a good chance things are online and while I am going to keep the initiate cohort events and build cohort community on this checklist, that particular item may be more difficult.

- [ ] Longer term planning for lab w/ Nic
- [ ] Supporting author on lab and cohort papers
- [ ] Help plan and initiate cohort events to build cohort community

### Develop

As this quarter is focused on writing I feel that it would be a good opportunity to write out a rough draft of a more specific research statement. Additionally, by doing this "early" I can get thoughts from others in my cohort and lab about my ideas and also support them in developing their own statements.

- [ ] Write a more specific research interest statement ("open infrastructure leads to open processing -- the promise of social computing")

### Council Data Project

I am not going to put down any specific CDP related goals for this quarter, the yearly goals summarize them well and I will probably check some of them off. Additionally, CDP JASIST paper was added to the write and submit goals for this quarter so there is a major CDP deliverable already. As a part of that paper, there is a lot of work in helping other municipalities set up their own instances and getting a basic dataset and Python API working.
