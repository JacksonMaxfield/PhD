# General Exam

This directory contains documents related to my general exam.

If all goes to plan, I will take my general exam ~2.5 years into my PhD.

## Prospectus

[Prospectus](prospectus.md)

The major point of feedback I received from my committee regarding my prospectus was that I should include more specific details about my proposed research. I gave them more details over email / messaging, but I haven't updated the prospectus with those new details.

## Reading List

Generally, my four major areas of interest are:

* **Machine Learning**, with a focus on **Natural Language Processing**
* **Science of Science**, with a focus on **Science of Scientific Software**

Major points of feedback for my reading list was that due the speed that ML and NLP move at, some of the older papers I had originally added to this list have been removed in favor of survey papers that are more recent.
