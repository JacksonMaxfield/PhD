# Technological Mediation in Public Comment

## Hypotheses

1. There is a difference in pro vs con overtime allowance in public comment.
2. Venue (In-person and online) mediates and removes or minimizes the difference in
   pro vs con public comment overtime allowance.

## Background

Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, time limits on in-person public testimony largely was
"enforced" through mutual understanding between community member. Councilmembers and
representatives would tell commenters when they had gone over time and occasionaly
the clerk may mute the commenters microphone but it was very rare for commenters to
be _strictly_ stopped right at the time limit. Commonly, public testimony would
go over time by a few seconds and this was generally allowed as long as it wasn't
multiple of time over the allowance.

In this way there was a common overtime allowance.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, all public testimony became virtual using conferencing
technology to carry out meetings and public comment. The difference however is that
the clerk was provided a much easier way to stop public comment through the ability
to mute any specific participant. Commonly, the moment or soon after public testimony
went overtime, the individual was muted, thus stopping their testimony entirely.

## Work Plans

1. Determine and codify the rules of public commenting
2. Find violations of rules and document how enforcement takes place
3. Determine measurement system (features) that can be applied uniformly to
   different venues to create dataset with.
4. Generate features and analyze to prove there is a casual determinant

End result of this should be:
A dataset showing lengths of time of comments and rule violation enforcement across
both periods (online and offline). Then, to show that by controlling for other
confounding variables that the new forum (online) results in a dampening of
one viewpoint or another.

## Addtional Comments

Be observant and additional look into if during the technology intervention
(of using the mute) public officials were systematically allowing overtime
allowances for certain bills and / or viewpoints.
