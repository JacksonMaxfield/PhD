# Year Two -- Updates, Planning, and Goals

## Updates from Year 1 Planning

### Publish

* The CDP infrastructure JOSS paper was accepted and published.
* Our early work on CDP analysis was/will-be published in the proceedings of ASIS&T AM 22.
* I contributed to the Howe Lab paper on different aspects of "smart city" technologies.
* Many other papers from prior work from AICS were published.
* Many projects were abandoned:
    * Campaign Website Accessibility Evaluations -- fell by the way side, I think largely due to me not really understanding how to continue and likely a lack of motivation.
    * Minutes Item Segmentation -- no major progress happened on this work and paper. This would be an incredible method and paper but lots of work. I am wondering if I can convince Nic and Bill to create a DRG with other PhD students to collective work on the combined alignment and generation subsets.
    * Controversial Datasets -- fell by the way side. This was a difficult period of the year for me. I think Winter depression and gender dsyphoria were at a maximum. However, I think this would be an interesting project to return to potentially with the lab. It definitely needs much more thought as to how to carry it out.
* Many projects are still in progress but have become more focused:
    * CDP General Analysis -- Our ASIS&T AM 22 Paper was, while good, lacking in analytical substance. We plan on expanding this paper into a full JASIS&T submission. I believe this should be quick and easy as long as we keep it to a dataset collection method and exploratory analysis paper with a few new methods for analysis included. I am excited about this work.
    * Speaker Annotation -- this has become two papers. First a JOSS paper focusing on the method of "few-shot speaker identification", and a full analysis paper that I am extremely excited about with an aim for CSCW. The analysis paper will be the first time that I will be delving into more traditional analysis work and not methods so I am both excited about the paper and excited about what I will learn in the process.

### Support

* I think I did an okay job at continuing to schedule lab meetings and pressure for lab outings (I still feel bad about spending so much money on bowling...)
* I wasn't the primary initiator of events in the cohort but I definitely was happy to join and pressure for more.
* I got to dip my toes into the Union and DSA work.
* Many things still left to figure out:
    * Longer term lab planning w/ Nic -- I would love to have more people in the lab meetings. Undergrads who are doing independent studies with us. Other PhD students or outsiders who can give us presentations. If I need to set this up, I think I can contribute to that.
    * BITS -> PIT lab website. We need to work on this. As publishing models change I think it is becoming more important to continue to post updates on Twitter + Blogs on our website and such. It seemingly is just a part of academia now.
    * Supporting author on lab paper. This one is I think doubly in progress. One, the entire lab is working together on the Software Searching / EAGER paper and I am extremely excited about that for us collectively. Second, while I don't know if I will be an author on the paper, Lindsey has mentioned that she would love help and/or guidance on the GigPlat analysis work when the time comes.

### Develop

While I think open processing is still incredibly interesting and I think I can use parts of my existing work on that topic in some sort of longer term plan or dissertation, I think my main topic now would be considered something like: "Computational Social Science for Political Analysis" -- this includes infrastructure, NLP, ML, CDP, etc. It is a bit more focused but leaves a little wiggle room. I still need to develop a larger plan for studying for my general exam and the future.

### Connect

* I reached out to a Amy Zhang's lab to join their lab meetings and that was quite enjoyable however I often found myself just out of time in the week so I began cutting back my visits as much. I would love to join that lab's meetings again soon however. I am also wondering if there are meetings in CIP or somewhere else that I may be welcome to join that may be just a tiny bit closer to what I am interested in -- a poli sci lab especially.
* I did not take a course outside of the iSchool last year but I am taking one now in Autumn 22 in CSE!
* If we count more "tech talks" towards civic tech groups, I gave at least three talks last year. Additionally I am presenting at ASIS&T AM22 this month.
* I don't think I really went out of my way to meet professors who could serve on my committee.

### Council Data Project

* We are now up to 17 (or 18?) instances at the time of writing with a few in waiting. I am finding scaling difficulties now.
* cdp-data is an early library but so far works well for dataset management.
* The team has actually shrunk a little and I think that is a bit nicer -- I was happy when people moved on to other projects and other parts of life. It's exciting to see others grow and change.
* While we did apply for an NSF grant to specifically cover CDP, we did not win the award. However we did participate in a CS&S incubator and due to this we have enough funds from it and Google research to cover our costs for a while.

## Goals

High level goals, more details in each individual section.

- [Better Time, Stress, and Work Management](#management)
- [Writing and Publishing](#publish)
- [Grow the Lab](#lab)
- [Connect with Other Labs and Professors](#connect)
- [CDP: Step Aside](#council-data-project)

## Planning

### Management

This has been a large stressor for me recently. I have struggled with feeling lost and not know what to work on and when to work on tasks and what remains ahead.

- [ ] Create deadlines, milestones, project plans. Try to stick to them. If something get's off track. Update the timeline.
- [ ] Better structure my days and my week. Create blocks of time to work on a single task if possible. Try to have a whole day for research work.
- [ ] Create better structure for collaboration -- undergrads. Write a document to share that talks about how *I* work best so they understand and have them do the same. Be a better advisor and mentor to them.

Sort of related: plan for applications to internships and grants.

- [ ] Apply to AI2, Microsoft Research, Adobe Research, etc.

### Publish

Many of the papers that I abandoned last year were in part due to my fear and unwillingness to "do the hard thing". I didn't want to learn how to conduct a literature review. I didn't want to learn how to outline and write a paper. In addition, _complete_ these papers.

I have put these in an order that I believe I can meet. Later papers are stretch goals.

- [ ] Speakerbox JOSS
- [ ] Speakerbox Analysis CSCW
- [ ] CDP Dataset JASIS&T
- [ ] Software Searching / EAGER

Stretch goals and others that I am not the primary contributor towards:

- [ ] Gig Plat
- [ ] Document Alignment and Outline Generation
- [ ] CDP Special Interest Groups

### Lab

I learned a lot last year about how much I want collaborative environments. Even if we aren't all working on the same research or paper, I like being able to discuss and share. Additionally with my minimal experience in working with the undergrads this last summer, I want to get better at growing the lab and collaborating.

- [ ] Better meeting structure -- this will likely change if we grow the lab and bring in more people to share their updates. If so, I wouldn't be opposed to returning to the one-slide rule.
- [ ] Bring in guest speakers! I want to personally take this on and suggest people to Nic and then reach out to them myself.
- [ ] Schedule more lab outings! I want to personally take this on and try to schedule something every couple of weeks.
- [ ] Have more of an online presence. Even if it's unfinished work we should be able to talk about it!

### Develop

Develop an early idea of dissertation and more specific research area. I have a general idea of what I am interested in: "open processing and open infrastructure, how it's built, how it's maintained, it's successes, and it's failures." However I have so far only really focused on Council Data Project which, while CDP is "open infrastructure" in my opinion, I can't focus too heavily on it as it is just one project in the world of "open infrastructure" problems.

Planning for future research to address these concerns will help reduce my stress long term.

- [ ] Write a more specific research interest statement
- [ ] Brainstorm a couple of "open processing" and "open infrastructure" research questions to work on next year
- [ ] Plan for developing an infrastructure besides CDP, show knowledge in multiple domains that both require infrastructure development
