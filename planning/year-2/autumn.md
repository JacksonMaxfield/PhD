# Year Two -- Autumn Quarter -- Planning and Goals

## Goals

Each quarter planning should be a subset of the yearly planning goals. Things change quarter to quarter but in general quarters should take and focus on individual parts of the year planning.

High level goals, more details in each individual section.

- [Implement a better time and work management system](#management)
- [Wrap up current projects and publish](#publish)
- [Build a lab presence online](#lab)
- [Deliver CDP dataset to a few people](#council-data-project)

## Planning

### Management

Create a time and work management system that helps me stick to deadlines and know what needs to get done. Further, update CV and apply to a few internships.

- [ ] Create deadlines, milestones, project plans -- try to stick to them, if something get's off track, update the timeline.
- [ ] Better structure my days and my week. Create blocks of time to work on a single task if possible. Try to have a whole day for research work.
- [ ] Apply to AI2, MSR, Adobe Research, etc.

### Publish

Wrap up current projects and papers and submit them all.

- [ ] Speakerbox JOSS
- [ ] Speakerbox Analysis CSCW
- [ ] CDP Dataset JASIS&T

### Lab

This quarter is focused on time management and finishing up projects, therefore, if everything goes to plan, we should have things to post and talk about online!

- [ ] Better meeting structure -- this will likely change as we grow the lab and bring in more people to share their updates. If so, I wouldn't be opposed to returning to the one-slide rule.
- [ ] Schedule more lab outings! I want to personally take this on and try to schedule something every couple of weeks.
- [ ] Have more of an online presence. Even if it's unfinished work we should be able to talk about it!

### Council Data Project

I don't think I will have the energy to wind down my role in CDP (ironic) so this quarter will be maintain the current leadership with me as BDFL and focus a bit more on research outputs.

- [ ] Deliver the CDP dataset to a few poli sci people.
- [ ] Plan a CDP dataset workshop!
